# Minetest-Worldmods
A collection of worldmods used on the VF-TECHNIC minetest server.

## Highlights
- insane amount of bug fixes to pretty much every mod
- fixing all bugs and offsets in `/vehicles` _(D00Med Vehicles)_
- addition of biofuel chainsaws _(based on technic chainsaw)_
- addition of powerbank mk4 _(zero-point energy)_
- addition of super biofuel and super propane
- fixes to all bugs in [technic_tweak](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=14510)
- additions to technic_chests _(such as titanium vacuuming chest and amethyst mining chest)_
- merging of [space_travel](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=23455) with [other_worlds](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=16015) to create a more diverse set of asteroid layers, the vanilla space_travel mod produced too much lag to run online as-is.
- modification of all technic_armor skins to remove specular highlights
- some new admin commands in `/exploration` such as a jailing system for disruptive players.
