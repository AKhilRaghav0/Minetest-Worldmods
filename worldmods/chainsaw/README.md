Chainsaw from technic mod but takes damage rather than charge, requires basic_materials, biofuel and moreores to craft.

Modified to add two types of chainsaw:
- Chainsaw MK1: 60 uses, cant be used as weapon. (left click to chainsaw)
- Chainsaw MK2: 32767 nodes can be cut, can be used as a weapon. (left click to attack, right click to chainsaw)
